"""Bundle export: asset list + per-store reports + photos in one ZIP.

Mirrors the per-store deliverable layout produced by the legacy Feishu pipeline

cross-store ``asset_list.xlsx`` for per-week/batch consumption.

The ZIP is written to a spooled temporary file (spills to disk above 10 MB) so a
large batch never holds every photo in RAM, and is returned as a FileResponse.
